# Demos With All Data
The demos in this notebook use all the embeddings for the TCGA or OpenI. However, because the embedding API is currently not batched, we need to get every single embedding individually. The approximate speed limit of pulling embeddings is currently 30 embeddings per second. With approximately 25,000 TCGA embeddings (sum of 3 modalities) and 6000 OpenI embeddings (sum of 2 different embedding types), this becomes intractible. As a result, these demos still currently use static files saved in the workspace to load these embeddings. These demos will be updated once the batched embedding API is implemented.
